All scss files are in the styles folder. The styles folder is sepeated by 'main', 'html', 'bits-ui'.
CatDog DS is not affliated with bits-ui but it on top of it so you need to install it first. Documentation for bits-ui at [`bits-ui-documentaion`](https://www.bits-ui.com/docs/introduction).

To install bits-ui use the following command.

```bash
# install bits-ui
npm install bits-ui

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```
